I welcome anyone to revise what I am about to say.\n\n**The theory goes you don't want to tax the rich because** they create jobs. If you tax them too much they might try and leave the country or they won't create jobs. Taxing the rich is also seen as \"punishing success\". These people have worked hard to reach the level they've gotten to, so taxing them is considered, by some, to be a punishment.\n\n**Now as a criticism** - tax cuts in no way guarantee job creation. If I come upto you, give you a tax cut and say, \"Right, now go create a job\" then skip off, \"tra la la ling\" on my merry way, are you necesarily going to create a job? It sounds like a plan, but the best way to fuck up a plan is to put a human in it.\n\nIt isn't like I have ordered you to create a job, and to order you would probably be an over reach of my mandate as the government. That would be an example Big Government, which I believe Republicans despise: telling you how to spend your money. No. Why create a job when I could buy a new car, or a new house? It's *my* money, *I* earned it.\n\n**Now as for taxing the rich**. I hate the idea of punishing success. The very idea of income taxes can be viewed as a form of success punishment. However, taxes are the price you pay for living in a civil society. The reason the rich pay higher taxes is because, put simply, they can afford it, it's why taxation moves in a progressibe scale. There is a certain level of income people have to earn for basic utilities, after this and taxes, you are left with disposable income. The rich have more of this disposable income. Also, with things like inflation, the rich have much more of a buffer against this natural economic force. The poor do not. \n\n**\"But why should the rich pay more taxes?**, they don't benefit from social security and other government programs\" Maybe not directly, but indirectly they do. If you are a business owner, your workers, on one level, are your property. Not in a slave-like sense. Your workers are tools, and these tools need to use roads, the need education, they need a level of healthcare, water, housing etc Your taxes go to the government and these taxes go to things like the aforementioned infrastucture. It may be indirect, but you *do* benefit from this. If your workers have a better standard of living they are going to be more productive.\n\n**So what creates jobs?** Well, demand. Some might disagree with this, but let me explain my argument. Every economy relies on supply and demand. It is like the economic \"heartbeat\". What proponents of supply side economics (trickle down/reaganomics) theorise is that of you give the job creators more money they will use that money to make jobs. I have already criticised this, but as a further criticism, like I said the economy relies on supply AND demand. If you take a one-sided approach to the economy you are going to have problems. You are ignoring a whole second side of the coin.\n\nSure, I can give you tonnes of money and say, \"Have fun! Go create jobs!\". And you can do this, but they are wasted jobs. Without the contrasting demand its a ghost job of sorts. Demand is *just* as important as supply. The reason jobs get lost is because demand decreases, thus less money is accrued, thus a job becomes redundant. If the lower classes don't have enough disposable income, they won't spend it. If they don't spend it jobs become useless, thus those people get made unemployed..these people can't buy anything, thus more jobs get lost and it becomes a domino effect.\n\n**TLDR - I am probably as confused on many of these issues as you are and I know it's a long post but it was the best I can do.
